%TODO mandatory: add short abstract of the document
\begin{abstract}
Primitive recursive functions are a class of computable total
functions on natural numbers. While they are a standard topic in any
class on computability, it is less well known that primitive recursive
functions generalize in several dimensions. One dimension generalizes
to words, terms, and many-sorted algebras. Another dimension
generalizes to vector-valued functions. Both of these dimensions are
subsumed by first-order primitive recursive functions on inductive
types in a cartesian and cocartesian category (PR1-IND). 
A third dimension adds higher-order functions to obtain System-T from
primitive recursion on natural numbers; analogous systems for
words, terms, and many-sorted algebras are conceivable. At this point, we can subsume
all previous systems in a simply-typed lambda calculus with
inductive types and a primitive recursor (PR-IND). This calculus is
situated in a cartesian closed category with all finite coproducts.

We exhibit executable definitions in Agda of several classes of primitive
recursive functions in pointfree style and give embeddings from each
class into the next more general class. We particularly emphasize
PR1-IND and PR-IND.
While the first-order language PR1-IND requires a distributivity axiom
(i.e., the underlying category is distributive), this axiom is no
longer required in PR-IND, because its underlying category has
exponentials.
This finding corresponds to a folklore theorem that every cartesian
closed category is distributive and we give an elementary proof of
that theorem.
All definitions, embeddings, and proofs are given in Agda.
