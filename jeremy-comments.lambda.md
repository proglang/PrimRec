"semantics of PR-Nat in Agda"
The capitalization is different here, "PR-Nat" instead of "PR-NAT".
Is that intentional?

"Finally, we extend PR-FO with exponentials to PR-HO"
add a verb like "form", "create", or "define"
"Finally, we extend PR-FO with exponentials to define PR-HO"

"obsolete as it derivable in a bicartesian closed category"
missing "is"
"obsolete as it is derivable in a bicartesian closed category"

77
"All definitions, results, and proofs are mechanized using Agda [?]"
broken citation

PR-FO syntax also differs from PR-NAT in switching from n-ary
functions to unary functions. Perhaps that is worth commenting on?

226
Where is ⇐ defined? Ahh, looking at the agda code I see that it is
single substitution. Perhaps that syntax should be introduced in
section 3.1?
